# ReadComicOnline-Downloader
A little script to download issues from http://readcomiconline.to/

#How To Use
If you're a windows user, grab the [WINDOWS BINARY FROM HERE](https://github.com/Xonshiz/ReadComicOnline-Downloader/blob/master/ReadComicOnline%20Downloader.rar?raw=true). After downloading, please extract the contents using 7zip/winrar etc.
Don't extract in places where you will need admin privilege. After extraction, just run the "ReadComicOnline Downloader.exe" and it'll ask you for the link of the series, enter the issue's link (example : "http://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Injustice-Gods-Among-Us-I/Issue-17?id=25075"). It will ask for permission to connect to internet, let it connect and it'll do what it is supposed to do.

#Upcoming Features
Not sure if I'll maintain this or not (as usual). But, anyway, here are certain things I'd like to do :

1.) Downloading whole series.
2.) Download series in a seperate folder.
